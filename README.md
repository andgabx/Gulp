# Automated Testing with Gulp and Sass

This project sets up an automated testing environment using Gulp and Sass to compile SCSS files, apply automatic prefixes, and synchronize the browser. The goal is to improve the development workflow, making the styling process easier and ensuring compatibility across different browsers.

## Dependencies Used

The project includes the following dependencies:

- **Gulp** (`^5.0.0`): A task runner that automates common front-end development tasks, such as Sass compilation, minification, and browser reloading.
- **Gulp Dart Sass** (`^1.1.0`): A Dart-based Sass compiler used by Gulp to convert `.scss` files to `.css`.
- **Gulp Sass** (`^5.1.0`): Another Sass compiler option compatible with the Gulp ecosystem, allowing flexible compilation choices.
- **Sass** (`^1.80.4`): The core Sass library used for processing SCSS files.
- **Browser Sync** (`^3.0.3`): A tool for live browser reloading and synchronization, enabling automatic updates during development.
- **Gulp Autoprefixer** (`^9.0.0`): A plugin that automatically adds vendor prefixes to CSS properties for compatibility with different browsers.

## Development Setup

With these dependencies, you can automate tasks in your front-end development workflow by compiling Sass, adding vendor prefixes, and reloading the browser automatically. This setup enhances productivity and ensures consistent styling across platforms.
